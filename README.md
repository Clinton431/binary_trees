Binary Trees:
This repository explores the concept of binary trees, a fundamental data structure used in computer science.

What are Binary Trees?

A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure where each node can have at most two child nodes: a left child and a right child. Each node typically stores a value (data) and references to its children.

Why use Binary Trees?

Binary trees offer efficient searching, sorting, and traversal algorithms. They are commonly used for:

Searching: Binary search trees allow for efficient searching by leveraging the ordered nature of the data.
Sorting: Trees can be used to implement sorting algorithms like quicksort and heap sort.
Hierarchical Data: Representing hierarchical relationships, like file systems or family trees.
Priority Queues: Priority queues, often implemented using heaps, prioritize elements based on a key value.
What's included in this repository?
